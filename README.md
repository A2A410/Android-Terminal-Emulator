# Terminal Emulator for Android



Terminal Emulator for Android is a terminal emulator for communicating with the
built-in Android shell. It emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital
Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes, so that programs like "vi", "Emacs"
and "NetHack" will display properly.

This application was previously named "Android Terminal Emulator". Same great
application, just with a new name. (The change was made at the request of the
Android trademark owner.)

This is a Fork from Terminal Emulator for Android that was developed by 'jackpal' from Github.

New Features will be added soon.
